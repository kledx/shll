# AI Update Log #003 - P-2026-002 v1 Complete and v1.2 Backlog

Date: 2026-02-13
Program: P-2026-002-test-agent
Scope: Mark v1 complete, move improvements into v1.2, persist progress artifacts.

## What Was Finalized (v1)
- Closed v1 regression scope as done.
- Confirmed core user flow stability:
  - Marketplace / Rent / Deposit / Swap / Withdraw / History
  - listing status refresh via on-chain userOf
  - indexer backfill resiliency against 429/timeout/failover churn
  - console refresh after execute for vault balance + transaction history
- Captured policy fixes already landed on-chain (WBNB approve + wrap/unwrap).

## What Was Moved to v1.2
- Policy bundle release workflow (config -> apply -> check -> audit).
- PolicyGuard hard slippage validation.
- Strategy preflight UI and better PolicyViolation diagnostics.
- Agent runtime auto-execution loop (observe/reason/plan/act/learn).
- Owner-withdraw hardening during lease and emergency timelock options.
- ERC-8004/reputation-oriented schema and indexing prep.
